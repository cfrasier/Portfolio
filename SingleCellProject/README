This document explains the files in here.

USE THESE FILES

User_interface.py

frame_gif_gen.py

binarizedbinner.py

INPUT FILES

geometry.txt is the coordinates for 3039 cells on one hemisphere of the early Drosophila embryo.

binarized_bdtnp.csv is the binarization data for all 84 genes at all 3039 cell positions.

THIS CODE WORKS AND IS MOSTLY BUG FREE

bin_graph.py is the code to generate the plot of the geometry.txt file.

frame_gif_gen.py is the code to generate multiple png images to be combined in a gif.

binarizedbinner.py is the code that tells which genes are on at which position from the binarized_bdtnp.csv file.

THIS CODE IS WORKS IN PROGRESS

frame_gif_gen_with_dir.py is the code to make the images and specify a new directory.

plots_graph.py is the code to generate the plot of the geometry.txt file AND the desired gene location coordinates to be graphed on the same axes.
